shipyard-provision
==================

shipyard-provision is a set of scripts to automate the complete deployment of a shipyard cluster, including the Shipyard Controller, the main controller server, a certificate authority for Docker TLS, and the ability to deploy any new Docker node simply by specifying an IP and SSH credential details.

This project is a work in progress, and is still being developed.

You can find the documentation, design specs, and implementation plans on the wiki.
